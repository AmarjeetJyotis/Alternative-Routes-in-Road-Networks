# Alternative-Routes-in-Road-Networks
Applied Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm to find the route which takes the shortest time to travel from source to destination in a given road network with randomly generated traffic. Imple- mented methods to avoid collisions between vehicles by dynamically changing their speeds. Used C++ and OpenGL library for simulation. C++, OpenGL
